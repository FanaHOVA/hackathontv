== Olympia

Olympia is a social app to interact with connationals during international sport events such as Olympic games or World Cup. Users can discover nearby bars that show their country game, connect with others to watch it together and play a pick 'em game to win free drinks and gear from bars.

The app was developed in 24h at the Tor Vergata hackathon.
